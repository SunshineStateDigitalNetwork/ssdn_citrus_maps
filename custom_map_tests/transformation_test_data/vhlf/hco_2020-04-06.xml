        <dc:description>(Biographical)  William Henry Luers was born on May 15, 1929. He served as American ambassador to Czechoslovakia between 1983 and 1986. In his role as ambassador, Luers hosted a range of American artists and writers in the Czechoslovak capital, in a bid to &#x201C;change the vision&#x201D; of American power from that of a military to a cultural force. Through such cultural diplomacy, Luers made contact and struck up friendships with prominent Czechoslovak dissidents, including V&#xE1;clav Havel. Luers witnessed Havel&#x2019;s transition from dissident to president first-hand and, later, hosted V&#xE1;clav Havel in New York City on his first visit in office. Luers has also served as American Ambassador to Venezuela, and as a diplomat in the former Soviet Union. Today, he teaches at Columbia University&#x2019;s School of International and Public Affairs. Luers refers to Havel as a &#x201C;unique soul&#x201D; and &#x201C;probably the most powerful legacy that the Czech people [will] ever have.&#x201D;</dc:description>
